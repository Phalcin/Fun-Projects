# Hexer's solution to the test questions

employee_hourly_pay = float(input("Enter the hourly pay"))
employee_gross_pay = employee_hourly_pay * 40
overtime_wages = employee_hourly_pay * 1.5


# You can change the variable names to whatever you want, just make sure it matches what the question is about.
#  Don't use AI much if you're a beginner else you'll suck at coding :)
