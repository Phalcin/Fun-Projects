# Hexer's solution

# 1. Personal information
# Display of name
first_name = "Emmanuel"
second_name = " Mensah"
my_name = first_name + second_name 
print(f"my name is {my_name}")

# Address
my_address = 'PO BOX 102 Buokrom Estates Kumasi Ashanti'
print(f"My address is {my_address}")

# Programme
my_programme = 'Information Technology'
print(f"The programme i read at school is {my_programme}")

# 2. Sales Prediction

total_sales = float(input('Please enter the total amount of sales: '))
profit_from_sales = total_sales * 0.23
print(f"The annual profit of Ghs{total_sales} is Ghs{profit_from_sales:.2f}")

# 3. Land calculation

one_acre = 43560
user_square_feet_input = float(input("Please enter the total square feet: "))
acres = user_square_feet_input / one_acre
print(f"{user_square_feet_input} square feet is equal to {acres:.2f} acres.")

# 4. if statement

x = float(input('write some number for "x" here: '))
y = 0
z = 0

if x > 100: 
    y = 20
    z = 40

print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}, z is {z}")

#5. else if statement

a = float(input('write some number for "a" here: '))

if a < 10:
    b = 0
else : 
    b = 99

print(f"a is {a}, b is {b}")

# That's whats up, dont write any comment from this picture to the solution. Bruh that's wassup.
